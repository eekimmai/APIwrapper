 API wrapper exercise

## Introduction

This is a short exercise to demonstrate knowledge of working with functions and API's. API is located at [herokuapp.com](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts)

---

## Functionality

There are two main features in this small application,

*Ordering the number of Facts about Cats in Alphabetical Order, and displaying the resulting fact after clicking on the button
*Putting in a random number of facts in the bar, >= 20, and it displays number of facts randomized

---

## Future Steps / Improvements

The functionality works however there is an issue, 
* displaying the number of facts user requires. Trouble implementing user input number in JavaScript file, and looping through the loop the number of desired times. 

Additionally, I would like to update
* layout of webpage - frontend usability, description, etc.
* css file for style and appearance
* javascript functionality - nesting loop within loop to display the amount of facts user wants
